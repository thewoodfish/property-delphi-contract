# The Delphi Contract
This repo contains the code for the delphi smart contract running on a typical substrate contracts node. The property oracle contract is very important because it records critical information about users of the network, the properties being secured or claimed, the claims and right to claim of the properties and so on, serving as a source of truth and decisions. We would examine the contract properly. The property delphi contract is completely built with <a target="_blank" href="https://use.ink">ink!</a> which is the best language for writing smart contracts.
